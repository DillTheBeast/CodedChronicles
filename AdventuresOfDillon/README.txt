Adventures of Dillon
Welcome to the Adventures of Dillon, a text-based RPG game where you get to choose a class, fight enemies, and go on thrilling adventures.

Gameplay
The game starts by letting you choose a class for your character. Each class comes with a unique weapon and abilities. The classes you can choose from are:

Berserk: Comes with an axe that deals 30 damage and has 5 speed. Ability to deal 2x damage for 3 turns.
Mage: Comes with a staff that deals 25 damage and has 10 speed. Ability to set enemies on fire, dealing continuous damage.
Rogue: Comes with a dagger that deals 15 damage and has 45 speed. Ability to dodge enemy attacks.
Archer: Comes with a bow that deals 20 damage and has 8 speed. Ability to shoot 2 arrows at once when bow is fully charged back.
The speed of a class determines the chance for a double attack (except for the Rogue class which gets a triple attack).

During an encounter with an enemy, you can choose to attack, block, use an item, or attempt to run. The block action takes you to a guessing game where you can deflect the enemy's attack back at them if you win.
